# GraphAlgorithms
This repository contains a set of projects, each based on a different graph algorithm.  
The first project, Graph Editor, is a tool that allows users to create both oriented and unoriented graphs. The following projects are visualizations of graph theory algorithms, built based on the first project:  

## MazeShortestPaths
-it takes a matrix as input from a file
-defines a maze based on the matrix  
-displays the shortest paths from a point on a map to its exits, using the BFS graph traversal algorithm  

## TopologicalSorting
-finds the topological sorting of the nodes and displays the corresponding graph  

## StronglyConnectedComponents
-finds the strongly connected components  
-it displays a new graph in which each node corresponds to a component  

## GenericMST
-finds the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph with the Generic algorithm  

## KruskalMST
-finds the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph with the Kruska algorithm in O(m*log(n)) complexity 

## ShortestPathFinder
-it displays the map of Luxembourg represented by nodes  
-the user selects a start node and an end node  
-it displays the shortest path between the two nodes using the Dijkstra algorithm   

## Ford-FulkersonAlgorithm  
-it finds the maximum flow in a network  
-the edges of the minimum cut are drawn with a different color
